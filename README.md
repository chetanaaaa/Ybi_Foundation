**Handwritten Digit Prediction and Classification Analysis Using Random Forest Model**

In this project, I have implemented a machine learning model to accurately classify and predict handwritten digits (0-9). Leveraging an 8x8 pixel image dataset of handwritten digits, I applied the Random Forest model. Through extensive research and hands-on implementation, I successfully developed a robust system for digit classification. The project involved data preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

**Movie Recommendation System Using TF-IDF Vectorization**

In this project, I created a movie recommendation system based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. I have used dataset of movie descriptions, which included Movie_Genre, Movie_Keywords, Movie_Revenue, Movie_Language, and Movie_Director. Implementing TF-IDF, I quantified the importance of keywords in the movie descriptions and utilized this information to generate movie recommendations.By inputting a favorite movie, the model provides movie suggestions tailored to the user's preferences.
